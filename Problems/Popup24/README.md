# Popup24 - Problem Solving and Programming under Pressure

All the problems that can be found in this directory are from the course [DD2458 Problem Solving and Programming under Pressure](https://www.kth.se/student/kurser/kurs/DD2458?l=en) 
that I took in the spring semester of 2024 at [KTH](https://www.kth.se/). Usually, there will be 3 files for each homework problem (which are located in the HWX folders): main.cpp, kattisio.h, and solution.h. The first 2 files
are only for submitting the work (for the course). In the solution.h file, the actual problem is described and a verbal as well as a solution in program code can be found.

Furthermore, there were also labs (located in the LabX folders), in which common algorithms and datastructures were implemented.
